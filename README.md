I am an aspiring **Full Stack Developer**, looking for an opportunity to work with an inspiring and fun tech team that delivers innovation. I'm confident you'll love working with me because I'm a great communicator, team worker and will be learning programming fast and hard. 

I studied philosophy but worked in finance - so I love developing ideas but I also like to be pragmtic and efficient, which gives me a great advantage as a programmer. I'm also someone who loves learning (In my spare time, I'm forever going through a long list of books and podcasts on new subjects), so I was so thrilled to discover programming as a profession.

Please take a look below at a suite of my coding projects, and if you are impressed for more, a list of my skill sets, professional experiences and others.

I'd love if you reach out to me for a chat at hello.ara@pm.me

**Tech Skills**: Ruby, Javascript, Test-Driven Development, Object-Oriented Design, HTML, CSS
